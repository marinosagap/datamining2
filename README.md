# Data Mining Techniques -- Data Exploration and Feature Selection

## About

  This is a **Data Mining** project, developed at **Spring of 2017** by
  **Agapiou Marinos** and **Kamaras Georgios** for the Data Mining Techniques course.
  The goal of this project is the understanding and the exploration(*data exploration*) of the input data, as well as the evaluation of their features (*feature selection*). For the implimentation we use the *Python* programming language and the tools/libraries: *jupyter notebook, pandas, gensim* and *SciKit Learn*.
  
## Parts

* Part 1: Data Visualisation, at Visualisation.ipynb
* Part 2: Classification implementation, using *Support Vector Machines*, *Random Forests* and *Naive Bayes*, at classification.ipynb
* Part 3: Feature Selection, at feature_selection.ipynb

## Documentation

For complete documentation (presentation of our code, our methods and our results) please see the files *visualization.pdf*, *classification.pdf* and *feature_selection.pdf*.
